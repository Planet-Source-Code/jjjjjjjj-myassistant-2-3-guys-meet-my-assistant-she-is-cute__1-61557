### Description

This is an upgraded version of, one of my early build software, which I am using for a long time. Basicaly this is shell executer which can handle WebAddress and Folder Path, listed alphabetically and execute in it's browser. This software is capable of loading on system startup . Current version can also perform advanced google search. Using this software you can save a lot of time specialy when you are working with Internet. Add your freequent visiting sites/folders to the list, dbClick when you need. You have search option for Web/Image/News/Group search. The sotware is a real cute looking one with many trasition effects and a pleasing appearance. The software can be minimized to system tray. The tray icon can also be used to bring the window to top. This will be a good resource for begginers in basics of registry access, file execution, saving/loading information with text files, using system tray.....etc. Enjoy!! and please leave your comments...
